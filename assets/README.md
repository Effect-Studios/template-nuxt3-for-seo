# Assets Directory
The assets/ directory is used to add all the website's assets that the build tool (webpack or Vite) will process.
<br><br>

The directory usually contains the following types of files:

- Stylesheets (CSS, SASS, etc.)
- Fonts
- Images that won't be served from the [public/](../public) directory.
> If you want to serve assets from the server, we recommend taking a look at the [public/](../public) directory.
